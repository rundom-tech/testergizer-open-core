# Testergizer: Open Core vs Pro

Testergizer follows an open-core model.

The Open Core provides a stable, deterministic execution and analysis engine.
Commercial capabilities are intentionally excluded and will be delivered in Testergizer Pro.

## Included in Open Core
- JSON-based test execution
- Strict suite and results schemas
- Deterministic run artifacts
- Step-level retries with classification
- CLI tools (run, validate, diff, flaky)
- Playwright-based execution (headed/headless)
- CI-first behavior and exit codes

## Out of Scope for Open Core
The following capabilities will **not** be added to Open Core:

- Test recorder
- Visual or screenshot assertions
- AI-based healing or selector repair
- UI dashboards
- Cloud or remote execution
- Team management or governance features

## Testergizer Pro (planned)
Testergizer Pro will focus on:
- Authoring and visualization
- Intelligent maintenance
- Collaboration and governance
- Advanced analytics
- Enterprise-grade workflows

This boundary is intentional and protects the stability of the Open Core.
