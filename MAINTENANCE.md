# Testergizer Open Core – Maintenance Policy (v0.1.x)

The v0.1.x line of Testergizer Open Core is considered stable.

## What may change
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Internal refactoring with no contract changes

## What will not change
- CLI command surface
- Test suite schema (v1)
- Results schema (v1)
- Artifact structure
- Exit code behavior

## Breaking changes
Any breaking change will:
- Trigger a new minor or major version
- Introduce a new schema version
- Be documented explicitly

## Feature additions
New features will be evaluated for:
- Backward compatibility
- Contract stability
- Open Core vs Pro scope

Significant new capabilities are expected to land in Testergizer Pro, not in Open Core.

## Governance

Testergizer Open Core is maintained by the project maintainer(s).

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.  
Changes to licensing, schemas, CLI contracts, or scope require explicit maintainer approval.
